Creating Images of people -who don't exist- using A.I. (and just my face as a starting point). See video results of me morphing into different ages and between masculinity and femininity in the folder *assorted_output_videos* (morphing also shown at end of accompanying youtube video). Effectively creates images of new people.

## Discussion

We effectively and efficiently manipulate a 512-dimensional hyperspace to extract and manipulate features such as age in a fine-tuned manner.  

## Potential of Neural Architecture in Scientific Application
Not even our best quantum physics algorithms can do this on such a large Hilbert Space. Here we manipulate the system (i.e. my face) in a fine-tuned manner. We can transition my face from baby to child to young adult to mid-20s (current age) to middle age to elderly without much distortion in-between. Due to our large set of input data, there's no impedement in transitioning between critical points (i.e. at puberty where my bone structure would change dramatically or extreme old age where my skin and hairline would change dramatically).

This more-illustrative application provides some clear analogies which we might apply to fields like quantum field theory or quantum chemistry, where manipulating feature sets might provide some much-needed scientific insights. E.g. some hyper-complex Superconducting systems are currently describable mathematically with relatively rough approximations such as 2nd-order Mean Field Theory. Using architectures similar to this--in conjunction with large experiment datasets--we might discovery some novel  features which simply are not practically calculable in quantum field theory. 

## Conclusion
I look forward to checking back in 2070 to see just how accurate this was.
